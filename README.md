# CRE-Investment-Optimization-Using-ML

A supervised machine learning model that can accurately predict which cities and property types to invest in based on multivariate analysis, KPI weighting, and statistical forecasts. This ML model is tested and trained on six scenarios to emulate numerous market conditions:

1. Base Case (control group)
2. Interest Rate Shock
3. Trend Growth                                    
4. Depression
5. Moderate Upside
6. Moderate Downside

### **Note:** This ML model is currently a work in progress

## Complete Project Documentation Coming Soon

### Documentation will include:

* Model Setup
* Steps Used in Feature Engineering (from Binning to Scaling)
* Development of Logistic Regression & Random Forest Models
* In-Depth Model Evaluation / Analysis
* Use of Class Balancing to Improve Model Accuracy
* Implementaion of `scikit-learn` and `SciPy` Libraries for Model's Train-Test Splits
* Execution of Variable Encoding (to Aid the ML Algorithm)
* Plotting & Analyzing the ROC Curve / Confusion Matrix
* Optimizing the Model's Bias & Variance to Improve Performance on Test Data
